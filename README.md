# Next.js 15 App Directory Fetch Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's app directory related to using `fetch` within an asynchronous function that handles form submissions. When a network error occurs during the fetch, the UI might not update correctly, resulting in a stale state.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when an asynchronous function in a component uses `fetch` to make a network request. If the request fails and appropriate error handling isn't in place, the component might not re-render correctly, leaving the UI showing outdated data.

## Solution
The solution involves thorough error handling, ensuring that the component always re-renders, even in case of fetch failure, to correctly reflect the error state or updated data.
