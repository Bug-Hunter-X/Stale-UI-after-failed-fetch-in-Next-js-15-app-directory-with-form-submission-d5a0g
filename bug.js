In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using the `app` directory's `fetch` within a component's `async` function that's also handling form submissions.  If the `fetch` call fails (e.g., network error), and error handling isn't meticulously implemented, the component might not re-render properly, leaving the UI in a stale state.  This is compounded if you're relying on state updates triggered by the `fetch` response.
